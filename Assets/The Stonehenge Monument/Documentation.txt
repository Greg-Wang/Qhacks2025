Thank you for purchasing The Stonehenge Monument Asset Pack!

This pack contains 72 rocks, and a moss shader.

The pack is neatly organized in folders for ease of access.

There are 3 different art styles featured in this pack, each of them having a different look form the other. The Realistic and the Stylized versions use the same models, thus you won't find any models in the stylized folder. 

The moss shader is easy to set up and work with. Feel free to play around with the settings and the sliders and see what results do you get!

All versions of the pack use the same colliders and you can find them here: The Stonehenge Monument\Stonehenge_Realistic\Art\Meshes\Colliders.
